# Breaking Down Instructions



### General think about while you work to understand instructions


- Are there any prerequisite steps?
- How do later steps impact the early steps?
- What pages do you have to navigate to for each step?
- Where do you find the resources needed? 
- What is a reliable resource to use for steps that you are not sure about? 

### Specific Hints

- which things from your content and feature issues yesterday require HTML vs only markdown?
- What is a pull request?
- when do you make a branch?

### Tips

- In github, if you have a checklist, you can hover over items to make separate issues
- You can link issues to pull requests to mark them done automatically when you merge the pull request
- You can make a branch from an issue page to have a space to work on that specific issue
