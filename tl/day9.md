# You can do hard things

A short discussion reflecting on the hard things accomplished so far, no new other study skills, instead a simpler activitiy as a break. 


I believe you can do hard things. I want **you** to believe you can do hard things. 



There are different types of learning.
- In school, you are most used to specific instruction and then showing that you remember the things they told you.  Sometimes we challenge you to use what you have learned to build new things. 
- Once you finish school, you have to keep learning, but self directed. You have to read things on your own, maybe you can use online resources or videos, but you will encounter things you need to figure out that there is no resource specifically for.  
- In college, we try to help you transition from learning what you are taught to learning on your own. We start with careful instruction in the 100 level classes and slowly make you do more and more of the work to figure out how to learn things so that when you graduate you are ready to learn independently at work or in graduate school. 
- Sometimes, however, the day that the instruction is not specific enough is a point where students feel stuck, because they see that when they are alone trying to do work for a class. Often they never really needed help before, because they were good at remembering what was expected of them, so they do not know how to get help or they feel to embarrassed to get help, so they suffer all alone.

I do not want you to suffer and stay stuck**

- I want you to learn how to get and use help effectively. 
- I believe you can do hard things. 
- I want **you** to believe you can do hard things. 
- I want you to get ahead at being more self-guided in your learning
