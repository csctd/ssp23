# Parsing Assignments 


## Reviewing class materials

Talk at your table about the following questions:


- What from UCS 160 could help you with this? 
- What does it mean to review class material? 
- How could you tell if you have done a good job reviewing?
---

My advice: 
-  Read over your notes (the jupyter notebook) and any materials (the prismia chat)
-  fill in more explanation and notes
-  make a list of key vocabulary
-  make a list of questions if you realize you do not understand something when you look back at it
---

## Practice 

What do you think you shoud expect in practice exercises? 
What does that mean? 

---

My tips: 
- Practice should be applying the content that you have already seen in class. 
- If something seems completely random and off topic, you might have misunderstood the assignment, ask for help asap. 

**this means you need to read assignments early and make sure you understand**

## Preview

What is the goal of doing work before class? 
What might be different about work you do to prepare than what you do to review or practice? 

---

Advice:
- When previewing or preparing, if you have questions, write them down and bring them to class instead of getting help asap. 
- Try to connect the new ideas to what you understand from the past class
- See if the new material helps clarify any of your existing questions
