Compatibility with web languages is equivalent to following the rules that define the web language. 

There is an independent, organizaiton, W3C for web [standards](https://www.w3.org/standards/about/)

[for each browser](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/chrome-edge-firefox-opera-or-safari-which-browser-is-best#:~:text=Which%20Web%20Browser%20Has%20the%20Best%20Compatibility%3F)

- Safari is *really* low on compatibility. 
- FireFox is okay, but commonly tested on important tech things because it hass better privacy
- Opera is good. 
- [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/) based are best (Chrome and [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/download-the-new-microsoft-edge-based-on-chromium-0f4a3dd7-55df-60f5-739f-00010dba52cf) are built on top of the same open source browser)

Code view:

Notice that for notebook files, the code view is hard to read.  This is why we sometimes use tools to convert so that things are both human and machine readable.

We like to do things in plain text as much as possible.

## Mermaid Syntax for diagrams

This lets you draw diagrams by writing out the structure in text. It's a pretty lightweight syntax for a lot of diagram types
