**you can work in GitHub.com for today's activity**

```{important}
Work in your profile-website repository
```

1. Update your README using the Template below. Make a new branch called `design` and open a Pull Request. Title your PR `Design Theory` 
1. Create an "Add Initial Content" issue on your profile-website repo. Include a checklist of content that you will want to add. 
1. Create a "New features" issue on your profile website repo. Include a checklist of what features you want your site to have. 
2. Draw a site map for how your site will be organized and add it to your content issue as a comment. You can use a drawing tool, for example [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) and upload it; use GitHub's native support for [mermaid](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams) diagrams; or draw on paper or the whiteboard and upload a photo. 
3. Draw a wireframe for your website and add it to your feature issue. *use the above for how to draw*
4. Add a `## Design` section to your README on your `design` branch. Describe how you will get your message across using design. Your description should include details on how you will use visual hierarchy, grouping and similarity.
5. Add an `## Accessibility` section to your README on your `design` branch. Describe how your site will be accessible to users with different impairments? What web accessibility testing will you run to ensure this?
6. When you are done, [request a review](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review) from Professor Armenti on your Pull Request and [assign](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/assigning-issues-and-pull-requests-to-other-github-users#assigning-an-individual-issue-or-pull-request) your two issues to Professor Brown. 

```{admonition} Challenge Question
How did I make the pages on this site numbered in the left side menu? Can you add that to your `ds-portfolio` repo?
