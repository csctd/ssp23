## Detailed Instructions

<!-- work here! -->
### Work in a Codespace to implement one content/feature addition to your site to practice HTML

1. choose a section to work on that is a theme variable
````{margin}
```{hint}
On an Issue, if you have a checklist, you can hover over items to make separate issues for each item and it will track progress on the first issue
```
```{warning}
If you cannot open a new codespace, look for one on the list that does not have uncommitted changes
on [your list of all codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces) on the 3 dots menu, select "stop codespace"
```
````
2. make an issue for the specific task
3. Under "Development" click create a new branch
4. on that popup choose **open in codespace**
5. reinstall nox on your new codespace with `pip install -U nox`
6. start your server with `nox -s docs-live`
7. find or create th right file and edit it
8. preview your site to see that it works
9. Go to the git tab in your code space (on the very left edge: <i class="fa fa-code-fork" aria-hidden="true"></i> )
10. Type a commit message above the commit button
11. commit the changes to the feature-specific branch 
12. sync to GitHub


### Create a pull request for your work.
