## How can you code more efficiently?

Practice and get used to your tools


## will there be a project with python?

Mostly some exercises

## What are we making with this code?

An analysis document


## what is the purpose of python

Raw is not used very often but is for special cases and data besides regular code or explanation. 

## Is there a prismia guidebook that is available for the students to use

[prismia guide](https://prismia.chat/guide)

## I want to learn more about different coding languages. 

That will come throughout your degree and in CSC 301 the whole semester and one section of CSC311 (does not yet exist, but will for FA24)

## What other data can we see in from article?

The other data is about violent crimes

## Is there a lot of occasions in coding where you have to write in the () for example earlier in the bar graph `(kind = 'bar')`?
Yes, using parameters in functions is very common

## What dose this site create or what kind of work would I do on this site? 

## Where to I find how this program likes to have things read. 


## Can you create your own lists?

Yes, you can do all Python code in jupyter. 



## Any other short cut tips that could be useful?

the [documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/commands.html#commands-list) has the full list, but that is for the newest version so it might be ahead of the version we are running.
