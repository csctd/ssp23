# Outline and work

## PechaKucha Outline
The PechaKucha 20x20 presentation format is a slide show of 20 images, each auto-advancing after 20 seconds. It’s non-stop and you've got 400 seconds to tell your story, with visuals guiding the way. PechaKucha was created in Japan in 2003 by renowned architects, Astrid Klein and Mark Dytham. The word “PechaKucha” is Japanese for “chit chat.”


1. Create an issue called Pechakucha on your profile-website repo
2. Draft your outline for your pecha kucha as a checklist


We'll spend 10 minutes on this for now, focus on just listing things to make it a to do list for yourself. 

Notes: 
- Items can be a specific visual or a concept that you'll choose an image for later
- Items can be open ended like "some code" or "friends". 
- you can finish this later
- you can change your mind later
- you can change the order later
- if you make it a checklist (`- [ ] item`) you can keep track of how many you have done
- if you want to keep the 2 images you already have, write them down as completed (`- [x] item`)

## Homework

1. Continue working on your site, including your peer review (from day 8)
2. Use your new css skills to customize further
3. Begin gathering your images
