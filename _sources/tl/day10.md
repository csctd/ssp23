## Outlining and task tracking

Using an issue to keep track of your work instead of just doing it is a really helpful step when you have multiple classes and tasks are time consuming, or have dependencies.  
It can feel like extra work to write it down first instead of just doing half, but having the plan will reduce the how much attention you have to pay to the task later. 
This time at the start while your mind is fresh and you are relaxed will pay off later when you might be tired or stressed about the deadline.
