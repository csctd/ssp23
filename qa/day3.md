# Day 1 Q&A

## Question 
if confused on something that u did and didnt post in the chat 
room how do i study that part while studying and also i thought variables 
start with "var" is that a different language 
### answer 
Declairing variables are typically different in each language . In python you declare a variable by doing 
variable name = whatever you want it to be ( ex : x = 5)  . in c++ and java you have to specify the type of the variable
by doing int x = 5; . typically var is used in javascript, which you will see later in csc 106 . As for what to study 
I would recommend going throgh the prismia fully and reviewing all the code sent playing around with all of the functions
we have used in jupyter hub 
## Question 
‟I am still a little confused on writing the groupby code, like I 
am able to explain the chart but not sure how the actual code works”
### answer 
GroupBy allows us to group the data based on different features to get a more accurate idea about your data ( ex: race  ) 
a groupby would put all the like data together in a group. you can also group by multiple things . The groupby() is a feature 
of the pandas library. 
## Question 
‟is there like a tool that could help us finish codes if we forget?”
### answer 
There are certain ides(integrated development environment) like vs code that have features that catch your mistakes 
and recommend answers for you . But in general when you forget to do something google is your best freind . you can always 
search through stack overflow ,youtube and other sites to find the answer your looking for expecially if its only synthax
(how to write it) and not logic . But its important to remember that these tools are just meant to help you get started with 
your programs not write it all for you . 
## Question 
‟how do you make a pie graph?”
### answer 
 - 'pie' : pie plot ; however a pie chart requires either y column or 'subplots=True'
## Question 
‟I dont get how "race_score_recid.T.plot(kind='bar')" graph is like completely different than "race_score_recid.plot(kind='bar')"”
### answer
The .t transposes the graph so essentially it flips the graph so the graph will come out looking very different
