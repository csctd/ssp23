# Day 1 Q&A

## Question 

## if confused on something that u did and didnt post in the chat 
## room how do i study that part while studying and also i thought variables 
## start with "var" is that a different language 

## answer 

Declairing variables are typically different in each language . In python you declare a variable by doing 
variable name = whatever you want it to be ( ex : x = 5)  . in c++ and java you have to specify the type of the variable
by doing int x = 5; . typically var is used in javascript, which you will see later in csc 106 . As for what to study 
I would recommend going throgh the prismia fully and reviewing all the code sent playing around with all of the functions
we have used in jupyter hub
